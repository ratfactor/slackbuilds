Dave's Slackbuilds!

There are only the slackbuild files as submitted to
slackbuilds.org in this directory.

(Though I may or may not submit everything I create here.)

All testing (including downloading the application source being
build) is NOT done in this directory. 

Instead, I make the tarball for each in this outer directory:

    $ tar 

/root/ because that's where I'd be doing that
if I were actually using these through sbopkg or manually from
the website.
