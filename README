Dave's Slackbuilds!

There are only the slackbuild files as submitted to
slackbuilds.org in this directory.

(Though I may or may not submit everything I create here.)

All testing (including downloading the application source being
build) is NOT done in this directory. 

Instead, I make the tarball for each in this outer directory:

    $ ./tar-it-up.sh <dir_with_slackbuild>

And then switch to superuser and copy the resulting .tar.gz to /root because
that's where I'd be doing that normally anyway.

    $ sudo -i
    # cp /home/dave/slackbuilds/<package>.tar.gz .
    # tar xf <package>.tar.gz
    # cd <package>
    # grep DOWNLOAD *.info
    DOWNLOAD="https://example.com/<package>.tar.xz"
    DOWNLOAD_x86_64=""
    # wget https://example.com/<package>.tar.xz
    # ./<package>.SlackBuild
    ...
    Slackware package /tmp/<package>-x86_64-1_SBo.tgz created.

    # installpkg /tmp/<package>-x86_64-1_SBo.tgz
